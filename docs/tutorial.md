# BAS 2022 - How to Begin Your Journey: Hands on Basketball Analytics with Python

---

## Overview

This repository provides a sample project demonstrating how you might set up and use Python to address a 
basketball analytics problem of interest. In this example we analyze the question of predicting NBA win probability
during a match (i.e., live or in game).

Any analytics or data science project, Python-based or not, has a handful of standard steps that are taken, such as:
1. Problem formulation
1. Data gathering and cleaning
1. Data exploration and visualization
1. Data analysis, feature generation and modeling
1. Evaluation and reporting

In addition to these standard research steps there is additional work needed to set up and define the working environment
and dependencies as well as any additional considerations around running and deployment of the solution.

Below we describe the approach taken to these and other steps in detail.

## Usage

The tutorial is laid out in a series of feature branches, each building upon one another toward the full solution in
the `main` branch. These feature branches are listed below and the tutorial can be followed by checking them out in 
succession (i.e., `git checkout <feature_branch_name>`) and following the relevant documentation.
