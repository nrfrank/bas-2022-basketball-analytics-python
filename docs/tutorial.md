# BAS 2022 - How to Begin Your Journey: Hands on Basketball Analytics with Python

---

## Overview

This repository provides a sample project demonstrating how you might set up and use Python to address a 
basketball analytics problem of interest. In this example we analyze the question of predicting NBA win probability
during a match (i.e., live or in game).

Any analytics or data science project, Python-based or not, has a handful of standard steps that are taken, such as:
1. Problem formulation: This initial step involves framing the problem you want to address and the relevant context.
   You might ask questions like
    * What is the question you want to answer or problem you want to solve?
    * What expectations do you have for the outcome (i.e., what's your hypothesis)?
    * How can you go about validating or refuting that expectation?
    * What data are available and from which sources? Are the data reliable? Do they require annotations or labeling?
    * Who is the intended audience for this work?
    * What defines "done" (or at least "good enough")?
1. Data gathering and cleaning: Once you've defined your problem and identified potential sources of data, the next step
   is to gather and clean the data. While I've put "data exploration" in the next step, there may be limited cleaning
   you can perform without at least inspecting the data to some degree and, in this regard, there's a bit of a feedback
   loop between these steps.
1. Data exploration and visualization
1. Data analysis, feature generation and modeling
1. Evaluation and reporting
